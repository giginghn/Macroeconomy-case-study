In this project, I want to explore the effect of exchange rate shock on output, inflation, and net export. 

Techniques used in this project:
Structural Vector Autoregressive (SVAR) to manipulate the time series data in R.

I took the data from year 1870 to 2016 to analyze.

Data Exploratory and analyzing process:
1) Tests of stationarity (Dickey-Fuller test)
2) Stationarize data
3) Model estimation
4) Result interpretation
